# urllib-tester

## What & Why?
urllib-tester is small tool to test connections with Python's urllib2.
I've started to experience SSL problems with one of the applications I regularly
use, and unable to find the underlying problem, so I decided to develop this
small tool.

## How it works?
It tries to connect to the addresses you provide via command line and returns
the results of the connection attempt.

## Current state
The code is currently at early development stage and will improve to the point
where it meets my requirements.
